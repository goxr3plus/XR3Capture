### Add it to your project using JitPack :

[Link][jitpack-url]

### Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file
``` XML
<repositories>
	<repository>
	   <id>jitpack.io</id>
	   <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
        </repository>
</repositories>
```

### Step 1. Add it as a dependency

* JavaFX-Web-Browser for Java 9 - (9.x)

``` XML
<dependency>
	 <groupId>com.github.goxr3plus</groupId>
	 <artifactId>JavaFX-Web-Browser</artifactId>
	 <version>V9.12</version>
</dependency>
```

* JavaFX-Web-Browser for Java 8 - (3.x)

``` XML
<dependency>
	 <groupId>com.github.goxr3plus</groupId>
	 <artifactId>JavaFX-Web-Browser</artifactId>
	 <version>V3.12</version>
</dependency>
```


# From version V3.11 it is completely embeddable!!!

What that means ? Well you can download the jar file with Maven , Gradle etc ( the depencities will come along ) and use it inside your application . 

--> You don't believe me ?? ( I am already doing this with [XR3Player](https://github.com/goxr3plus/XR3Player) ) 

--> How you can embed it inside your application ? ( Use [JitPack.io](https://jitpack.io/#goxr3plus/XR3Capture/V3.12) )

### Add it to your project using JitPack :

https://jitpack.io/#goxr3plus/XR3Capture

### Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file
``` XML
<repositories>
	<repository>
	   <id>jitpack.io</id>
	   <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
        </repository>
</repositories>
```

###  Step 2. Add the dependency
``` XML
dependency>
	  <groupId>com.github.goxr3plus</groupId>
	  <artifactId>xr3capture</artifactId>
	  <version>V3.12</version>
</dependency>
```

Then from inside your code you can create an intance or multiple instances of Browser like this:

``` JAVA
public XR3Capture xr3Capture = new XR3Capture();
```

and very simply open the  window :

```JAVA
xr3Capture.stage.show();
```

Happy :) ?  Cause i am ...
